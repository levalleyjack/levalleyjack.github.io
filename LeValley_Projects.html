                            MIT App Inventor 2.</a> I built this game with Aneela Mocherla on a goal to create a game that resembles 
                            Atari Breakout. Completed on 10/4/17  The goal of the game was to break all the blocks without letting the ball hit the bottom 
                            of your screen. Now due to the restrictions, a line of code that bounced off a direction based on where 
                            you hit it was seemly impossible. I did though, create code using each half of the paddle to determine 
                            the direction in which it hits. It consists of 5 levels, each with their own layout. App Inventor was a 
                            good starter language for me and it helpped me understand more advanced languages such as HTML, CSS, and python. </p>

                    <p>Using python and the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm">Python Imaging Library</a>, 
                    I finished the <a target = "_blank" href = " https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-AkMGmh-B1TjvVm8KLAshRfFwAgd_ZOF-DGW1mJY_o/edit?usp=sharing">project</a> on 3/25/18 for my Computer Science and Software engineering class. The objective of the project was to allow one to submit images into a file and ask the code to manipulate 
                    the image(s). You are able to manipulate it in specific ways such as adding a border, a logo, the color of the border, the 
                    location of the logo, the transparency of the border, and more. With my partner, Jonathan Wang, we learned alot more about
                    python and using libraries. With the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm">Python Imaging Library</a>, 
                    we achieved our goal to make a versitile product using what we know from lesson 1.4.</p>

                    <p>The objective for <a target = "_blank" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3Ilx-r4AX7f7ambhhxkXx7nIoAHmGSU0OxGjycR_dM/edit?usp=sharing">our project</a>, submitted on 9/12/18 for our Principles of Engineering class, was to create a machine that would utilize four different simple machines and perform a task. My job was to first build the pulley that would connect with a level to drop the peanut. After it would drop, I built a second pulley that would drop the weight and smash the peanut. Lastly, I worked on the documentation's design brief, calculations, and conclusion. A problem we ran into was that our solution did not require one step. We ended up having to turn two different wheels in order for our compound machine to work. In the end, we learned a lot and I was glad that everyone's ideas could go into this project.</p>

                    <p>The goal of my teammate and I’s <a target = "_blank" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gH2xPFSI4111enkBCV4_sMydDQUcAufZN55u2aJawig/edit?usp=sharing">project</a>, finished 3/19/19 for our Principles Of Engineering class, was to design and test a stable and low cost 2-lane bridge using the West Point Bridge Designer Software. My responsibility was to draw up two different designs considering the stability of the bridge, the cost, and the material that the bridge would be made of. I would have to decide the effectiveness of a pier and its cost, along with which material and which cross-section to use to fit each problem and it’s situation. My teammate and I built a decision matrix using average values and details from the feedback of the software which lead us to choosing my first design. I worked lastly on our <a target = "_blank" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gH2xPFSI4111enkBCV4_sMydDQUcAufZN55u2aJawig/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>, explaining why we chose our bridge design and why it worked the best out of all of the others considering composition and the shape of it. All in all, I learned a lot what goes into designing a bridge and what to consider when creating future ones.</p>
