                    <h2>MIT App Inventor Project: Breakout</h2>
                        <p>My project was built using <a target = "_blank" href = "http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/about-us.html">
                            MIT App Inventor 2.</a> I built this game with Aneela Mocherla on a goal to create a game that resembles 
                            Atari Breakout. The goal of the game was to break all the blocks without letting the ball hit the bottom 
                            of your screen. Now due to the restrictions, a line of code that bounced off a direction based on where 
                            you hit it was seemly impossible. I did though created code that used each half of the paddle to determine 
                            the direction in which it hits. It consists of 5 levels, each with it's own layout. App Inventor was a 
                            good starter language for me and it helpped me understand more advanced languages such as HTML, CSS, and python </p>

                    <h2>Python Image Manipulation Project</h2>
                    <p>Using python and the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm">Python Imaging Library</a>, 
                    I finished the project on 3/25/18 for my Computer Science and Software engineering class. The objective of the project was to allow one to submit images into a file and ask the code to manipulate 
                    the image(s). You are able to manipulate it in specific ways such as adding a border, a logo, the color of the border, the 
                    location of the logo, the transparency of the border, and more. With my partner, Jonathan Wang, we learned alot more about
                    python and using libraries. With the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://effbot.org/imagingbook/pil-index.htm">Python Imaging Library</a>, 
                    we achieved our goal to make a versitile product using what we know from lesson 1.4</p>
