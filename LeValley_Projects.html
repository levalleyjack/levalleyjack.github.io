                    <h2>MIT App Inventor Project: Breakout</h2>
                        <p>My project was built using <a target = "_blank" href = "http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/about-us.html">MIT App Inventor 2.</a> I built this game with Aneela Mocherla on a goal to create a game that resembles Atari Breakout. The goal of the game was to break all the blocks without letting the ball hit the bottom of your screen. Now due to the restrictions, a line of code that bounced off a direction based on where you hit it was seemly impossible. I did though created code that used each half of the paddle to determine the direction in which it hits. It consists of 5 levels, each with it's own layout. App Inventor was a good starter language for me and it helpped me understand more advanced languages such as HTML, CSS, and python </p>
