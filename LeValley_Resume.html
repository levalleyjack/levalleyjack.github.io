                <h3>Field Trips</h3>
                
                <p>As a sophomore student, I took a field trip to UC Davis which became my first visit to a UC college campus. While experiencing the college's beauty, I got my first true tour of a campus and opened my eyes to the way of life college students proceed with. A lot of students that our guide talked to seemed very energetic and succeeded in giving a great first impression of the college. It’s geography was breathtaking, as it’s entire town was almost focused on the college and it’s students as well as traversing the campus was easy due to it’s very flat nature. This experience was so memorable, because everything felt orderly without rigidity. Even though the ages between my group and the students were far apart, they all made us feel like we already knew the campus. It makes moving to college a little easier knowing I will be coming to communities that accept anyone.

                <h3>Inspirational Speakers</h3>
                <p>
                    A speaker who holds a special place in my memory is Natalina Bernardi P.E and LEED AP Civil Engineer and talked about what it takes to become a Civil Engineer. Having a successful background academically, she was very inspirational and persuasive when teaching us about the fundamentals of the job. I learned a lot about the pros and cons and education requirements of being a civil engineer and the registration/testing that goes on after getting a college degree in the same field. It's tough market and difficulty to learn made it stand out appealing rather than challenging. Her intelligence and attitude towards the job keeps encouraging me to consider the career that is Civil Engineering, which is very impressive, as I had never even thought about that field of engineering through anyone else.
