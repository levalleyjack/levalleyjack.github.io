                <h3>Field Trips</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>NASA Ames</h4>
                <p>My freshman year, I took a trip to NASA Ames where I toured inside the world’s largest wind tunnel and learned how engineers test the aerodynamics of certain aeronautical vehicles. I was able to talk with its employees and explore their diverse interests and routines working at NASA. I learned what projects government funding went to and what preparations they make to run testing in the wind tunnels. </p>
                
                <h4>UC Davis</h4>
                <p>As a sophomore student, I took a field trip to UC Davis which became my first visit to a UC college campus. While experiencing the college's beauty, I got my first true tour of campus and opened my eyes to the way of life college students proceed with. A lot of students that our guide talked to seemed very energetic and succeeded in giving a great first impression of the college. Its geography was breathtaking, as its entire town was almost focused on the college and its students as well as traversing the campus was easy due to its very flat nature. This experience was so memorable and definitely made me put the extra work into my waitlist essay for UC Davis. Even though the ages between my group and the students were far apart, they all made us feel like we already knew the campus. It makes moving to college a little easier knowing I will be coming to communities that accept anyone. </p>
                
                <h4>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories</h4>
                <p>In my Junior year, I also took a trip to the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories where I learned about the process to create fusion reactions using lasers that are scattered then focused on a single point to create the conditions required for a fusion reaction. I learned the history behind the project and the amount of planning in the construction of such a machine. They have not gotten a net positive energy return from the fusion experiments, but the progress they are making in the field is very promising. </p>
                
                <h4>Livermore Aviation Tour</h4>
                <p>My Senior Year, I went to the Livermore Aviation Tour where I got an online tour of the airport in Livermore and all the people it takes to keep such a busy facility running. I met the county sheriff and learned about their policies with drones and their plans for utilizing them. I would not mind working with the great people who guided us on the tour. </p>
                
                <h4>PBF Job Shadow</h4>
                <p>I went to the PBF Job Shadow where I learned a lot about the jobs that had to offer and how great of a path it is for those with or without college experience. It does not take a lot of education to start making money fast and has a high potential to generate a six-figure salary. I saw it as an interesting career path and a great way to do well for yourself even when starting with very little in life. </p>
                
                <h4>Chevron Career Day</h4>
                <p>On my final field trip, I went to a career day with Chevron employees. I met with many engineers and managers to discuss in small groups their experiences at Chevron, and the path they took to get there. Despite the bad reputation oil drilling gets, Chevron treats their employees very well and they explained the many avenues their company is progressing towards green energy. One common denominator between most of them was that they all had diverse types of jobs before their current employment. This left me with certainty that even though I am not where I want to right now, it's impossible to predict if it will stay that way.</p>
               
                <br>
                <h3>Inspirational Speakers</h3>
                <p>
                    A speaker who holds a special place in my memory is Natalina Bernardi P.E and LEED AP Civil Engineer and talked about what it takes to become a Civil Engineer. Having a successful background academically, she was very inspirational and persuasive when teaching us about the fundamentals of the job. I learned a lot about the pros and cons and education requirements of being a civil engineer and the registration/testing that goes on after getting a college degree in the same field. It's tough market and difficulty to learn made it stand out appealing rather than challenging. Her intelligence and attitude towards the job keeps encouraging me to consider the career that is Civil Engineering, which is very impressive, as I had never even thought about that field of engineering through anyone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another speaker who interested me greatly was Annabel Gomez, a sophomore at CalTech who is majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Over an online call I learned about Annabel’s fellowship experience at JPL, where she worked with scientists to improve the accuracy of navigation and communication by using machine-learning to iron out irregularities in signals. Her path from High School to college was very inspirational and gave me some thought on what my plans are for internships during college.
                </p>
                <h3>My Mentorship Program Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    The Dublin High Mentor Program has done a lot for me in the past few years. I know much more about the working world coming out of the program than I did coming in. I enjoyed talking with my mentor every month, as he helped guide me on my current strategies in schoolwork as well as my future goals for myself. I made many great connections that I still am in hold of today. I am glad I had this opportunity to receive this higher education and I can’t wait to see what this information will take me to in the future.
