                            <p>Born in the small town of Sammamish, Washington, I found a computer to be a challenge above none other. Not a difficult challenge, but one that was intriguing, nothing similar to anything else. Along with influences from friends and family, programming became a new dream of mine. With a subject like french you may only talk to one part of a continent, but with programming you can communicate with the entire world. I am persevering to find a job in the field of computer science, preferably with software development and getting my creative side put to use. Luckily, my high school offered computer science courses as well as an AP one. These classes will guide my path to learning about how to program a computer.</p>
                            <p>Using the ambitious side of me, I wanted to learn more about coding. Coding was the only school subject that brought a great amount of joy to working. Coding was one of the few activities that I found interesting enough to get myself self-motivated to do it. Besides being an elective, computer science was a class the stood out from others. Computer science brought fun to learning, as the more you learn, the more you can apply your learning. CSS and HTML were the two languages that really brought my interest to learning code. Even though I started with basic languages such as Scratch and App Inventor, HTML became a turning point in my interest in coding. Strides in subjects such as AI and aerospace are also very intriguing.</p>
                            <p>During my freshman year, I participated in Dublin High School Soccer, and in the Dublin United Soccer League. Both organizations taught me a great deal about teamwork and cooperating with others. Cooperation was a key theme in playing soccer, as I got to know people I never would meet regularly. Playing soccer made me less shy, more outgoing, and brought a lot of cooperation to the team. Everyone participated, making the team as one which built us towards greater things. The team brought a number of different people with different personalities to combine as one, which taught us valuable lessons not only in soccer. Soccer definitely changed me as a soccer player and as a person.</p>
